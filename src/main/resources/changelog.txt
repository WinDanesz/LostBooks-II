1.1
    - Featuring: actual lost books! When a book is dropped and left to expire, it has a chance (default 100%) to be captured and dropped or offered in a villager trade once at a later time. These books are saved on a per-world basis, like unique book blackouts.
    - Generated books will appear in villager trades (sold by librarians)!
    - New file structure! Your current book folders will work the same, apart from moving your words folder out of the adLib folder, but now you can also make your own folders within the main book folders with books (or more folders!) inside of them.
    - Individual book properties! Adjust drop weight and more!
    - Loads of new ad lib book functions, including better word categories and codes that generate more than just random words!
    - Lost Books will no longer cut off formats when it automatically inserts a page break!
    - Unique book data is now stored based on file name, so Lost Books will no longer reset all data any time you change the number of books you have!
    - Unique books now have an extra line on their tooltip that says "Unique". (Can be disabled.)
    - Many new stories! Several old stories (namely, ad libs) improved! Now over a thousand default words!
